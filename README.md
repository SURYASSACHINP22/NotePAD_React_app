# 📝 NotePAD React App

A modern, responsive note-taking application built with React, Tailwind CSS, React Router, React Hooks, and Redux.  
This application allows users to create, edit, and delete notes, with data persistence using the browser's local storage.

## 🚀 Features

- ✍️ Create, edit, and delete notes with full CRUD operations.
- 💾 Persistent storage (saved in the browser's LocalStorage).
- 📱 Responsive design using Tailwind CSS.
- 🔗 Seamless navigation with React Router.
- 🔄 State management with React Hooks and Redux.
- ⚡ Fast development experience with Vite.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React** – Frontend library for building dynamic user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **React Router** – Declarative routing for React apps.
- **React Hooks** – `useState`, `useEffect`, and others for component-level state management.
- **Redux** – Global state management for predictable state handling.
- **Vite** – Next-generation frontend tooling for fast build and development.

##🧠 Understanding the Core Concepts

*React Hooks*

useState: Manages the local component states (e.g., input fields, note content).

useEffect: Executes side effects, such as loading or saving notes to local storage.

**Redux:**

Manages global application state for all notes.

Actions and reducers handle adding, editing, and deleting notes.

Provides a predictable data flow using the Redux store.

# React Router
Handles routing between different components (e.g., note list, editor page).

Enables single-page application (SPA) behavior.

# Tailwind CSS
Provides utility-first classes for rapid styling.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
